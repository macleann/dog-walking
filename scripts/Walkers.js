                if the walker id = the clicked walker's id, then the matchingWalker should be set to the clicked walker object

            Then, i need to define a matchingWalkerCities variable as an empty array
            i will then iterate through the walkerCity objects
                if the walkerCity's walkerId = the matchingWalker's id, then i should add the walkerCity's cityId*** (previously i had been adding the whole walkerCity object) to the matchingWalkerCities array

            Lastly, i need to define a matchingCities variable as null*** (previously an empty array but i had a difficult time accessing properties within objects for string interpolation)
            ***Addendum*** i think i also need to define a function somewhere that concatenates strings of city names
            and again iterate through the city objects
                if the cityId in a walkerCity object in the matchingWalkerCities object = the city's id, then i should add the city object to the matchingCities array

            For the string interpolation, i think i can use destructuring to print all city names in the matchingCities array
